## **MVP Spec**

### **Goal**

## Build a real-time 4-player quiz combat prototype where all players answer the same question simultaneously and the team progresses through three monsters in sequence, each using increasing question difficulty, while sharing a team HP pool.

## **Player Flow**

1. Enter **Name** \+ **Room Code**

2. Join **Lobby** (max 4 players)

3. Start game

4. Battle loop:
   - Show **Monster HP** and **Team HP**

   - Show **Question \+ 4 answers**

   - Players submit an answer

   - Round resolves simultaneously
   - If monster HP reaches 0:
   - Load the next monster
   - Continue battle

5. End:
   - **Victory** if all 3 monsters are defeated

   - **Game Over** if team HP reaches 0

---

## **Core Rules**

- Room size: **1–4 players**

- Shared Team HP: single pool for the whole room. It is calculated at the start of the game by summing the base stats of all selected characters in the room.

- Each round uses the same question for all players

- Questions cannot repeat within a single run.

- Round timer: **10–15 seconds**

- No answer \= wrong

- Next round begins with a new question until game ends

- Correct answer → Monster takes damage

- Wrong answer or no answer → Team takes damage

- Round resolves when:
  - All players have submitted an answer, OR
  - The timer expires

---

### Monster Progression (MVP)

- The game includes 3 monsters preloaded in the database.
  - Monsters are fought sequentially:
    - Monster 1
    - Monster 2
    - Monster 3

  Each monster loads questions of increasing difficulty: - Monster 1 → Level 1 (easy) questions - Monster 2 → Level 2 (medium) questions - Monster 3 → Level 3 (hard) questions
